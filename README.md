## First-Year Innovation and Research Experience: Semester 1 project

### TL;DR:

This repository contains all of the major documents and results from my first semester research project as a part of the
FIRE120 course.

FIRE, the First-Year Innovation and Research Experience, is a set of courses designed to introduce freshman to research experience 
early in their college career.

My collaborators on this project were: [Richard Liang](https://github.com/RYLiang18), Darwin Ma, and Adam Kaushik.

### Project Summary:

For our project, we measured the relationship between public health, socioeconomic status, and the distances sample populations are away from cities. Our goal was to examine how socio-economic status and urban sprawl affected public health. Our data came from two main sources: **the Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) dataset**, which contains a variety of data on public health in thousands of U.S. counties and **the US Census Demographic Data**, a dataset compiled from the 2015 government census data.
